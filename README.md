# mlb_hof_predictor_refined

The following code creates a predictive statstical model aimed at predicting future Major League Baseball Hall of Famers within the currect field of active players. The data manipulated in this project is sourced and credited from Stathead.com by Sports Reference, and specifically their baseball database. The code utilizes the Pandas Python Library along with various other predictive model libraries. Additionally, graphic libraries are included to create visualizations of the data presented.

The program aims to predict Hall of Fame caliber players in the current crop of active MLB talent. First, projected stats are calculated for each active player, with a minimum of four seasons, up until a baseline age that is determined fit for retirement. Then, all Hall of Fame inductees, a select number of non-hall-of-fame retired players, and the players used in the projection are combined into one singular dataframe. Using the dataframe and each individual's 'status', a prediction model is created and fitted for the use of predicting who among current active players has the potential to be inducted into the Hall of Fame upon their retirement.
